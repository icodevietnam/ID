                        <p>We had a beautiful meal here last night to finish off our week long stay in Saigon. It was a really great meal and I would definitely go back. </p>

                        <p>I had the eggplant and cheese meatballs with the roasted veggies and tomato basil sauce. We also had the rocket salad to share. The food tasted fresh and delicious. I wish they had more permanent veggie meatball options though. </p>

                        <h3> The Deck Saigon </h3>
                        <p>I just visited The Deck last night and was looking forward to making this glowing review since we left. A group of friends and I had just completed a two week volunteer project outside of HCM and were more than ready for a delectible meal (and yes perhaps some Western choices as well!) I can't say...</p>

			            <p>Decadent! MZ's drinks, soup, and food were incredible! On our second visit, I asked for a veg. version of their pesto sandwich and they were extremely accommodating. Great staff and hostess! </p>

			            <h3> The Hungry Pig</h3>
			            <p>Me and my sister found this place for lunch yesterday. We wanted a bit of change from Asian food for one meal! My sister had the bacon special and thought it was delicious. I'm vegetarian and it was really easy to eat something here, you can just tick boxes to choose what's in your sandwich. </p>

			            <h3> Portofino Italian Restaurant </h3>
			            <p>As long time fans of Ciao Bella from our time here 2 years ago, we just had to go to its little sister Portofino on our return. As always, General Tony Fox was outside the front welcoming customers, and I'm convinced that the way he interacts with customers is 1 of the main reasons why all 4 of his...</p>
