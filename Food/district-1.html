					<h3>La Villa French Restaurant </h3>

					<p>Here for the business group dinner, individual pax had 7 dishes in total. Most of dishes are impressive, especially the scallop, steak and dessert. Timing service, courteous, well-demonstrated in the proficiency of qualified restaurant and prior in the town. Perfect revenue for dating, business meeting and family reunion...just a little bit far from the city center. </p>

					<h3>Ichiban Sushi Vietnam</h3>

					<p>The sushi was delicious! (as was the edamame and dumplings we ordered). The restaurant was also super clean and had a nice atmosphere. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We met the owner on our way out, and upon learning we were from the US (he is from San Francisco), we all had some sake... </p>

					<h3>Hum Vegetarian Cafe & Restaurant </h3>

					<p>Great restaurant with friendly and attentive staff. Menu was extensive and creative. We were here at a lunchtime and nearly every table was full. Would recommend the fresh spring rolls and pad thai.</p>

					<h3>Chilled Bar and Grill. </h3>

					<p>Just tried Chilled for the first time and was convinced to go inside by some very persuasive staff at the front of the restaurant - Miss Sakulia (apols if I misspelt your name). I ordered the Salmon, handcut chips, and veges. It was delicious.... Just wish the portion was a little bigger. </p>

					<h3>Baba's Kitchen </h3>

					<p>After spending the previous night stuffing myself silly on a foodie tour, my stomach was feeling a little worn out. I wanted something simple and not too spicy, almost a little bland and dry, and not too heavy. After walking the entire length of Bui Vien to see what I could find to fit the bill</p>

					<h3>Acacia Veranda Dining </h3>

					<p>A big banner in the lobby of the hotel offering Buy One Get One beer for Happy Hour was enough for us to give it a try. This became a regular venue for us to sit back with some beer and appies and chill out after daily sightseeing. The terrace was comfortable with some nice views. Service was great... </p>
